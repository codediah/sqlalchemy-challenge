# sqlalchemy-challenge

The variable path section of the flask app just can't be right, but I was running up against a time crunch and just wanted to have a basic structure to include. I was in a rush and couldn't remember how to run the app to test everything, so there's plenty that could be broken in the app.py file. 

Didn't know if I could store the date info outside each link, probably not but it looks cleaner for now.

Happy to fix this up more, sorry for the buggy app. That part was a fun stretch though!
